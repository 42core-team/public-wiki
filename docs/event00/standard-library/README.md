#### 🧩 `typedef struct s_obj`
Represents an object in the game, which could be a unit, core or resource.

```c
typedef struct s_obj
{
	t_obj_type type;             // Object type (unit, core, or resource)
	unsigned long id;            // Unique identifier
	unsigned long x, y;          // Object's coordinates
	unsigned long hp;            // Object's health points

	union {                      // Type-specific details for cores or units
		struct {
			unsigned long team_id;   // Team identifier (for cores)
		} s_core;

		struct {
			unsigned long type_id;   // Unit type identifier (for units)
			unsigned long team_id;   // Team identifier (for units)

	};
} t_obj;
```

*Good to know:*
- Cores belong to teams and are essential for the game's victory conditions (Your core has to be the last one alive to win the game).
- Units can either be workers or warriors and have specific stats like HP and position.
- Resources are critical for a team’s economic strength.

## 📊 Data Types

> Here you'll find the main data types and structures used in the game logic. These are essential for understanding how to interact with game elements, control units, and manage actions.

---

### 🏅 `typedef struct s_team`
Represents a team in the game.

```c
typedef struct s_team
{
	unsigned long id;            // Unique identifier for the team
	unsigned long balance;       // Team's current balance (used for unit creation, etc.)
} t_team;
```

*Good to know:*
- Balance is crucial for determining whether you can create new units or take certain actions. (Or just spam spawn the units but keep in mind that it's better having a logic behind buying units)

---

### 🔗 `typedef enum e_obj_type`
Represents the types of objects in the game.

```c
typedef enum e_obj_type
{
	OBJ_UNIT,                    // A unit (e.g., warrior, worker)
	OBJ_CORE,                    // A core (the base of a team)
	OBJ_RESOURCE                 // A resource (e.g., minerals)
} t_obj_type;
```

---

### ⚔️ `typedef enum e_unit_type`
Defines the different types of units.

```c
typedef enum e_unit_type
{
	UNIT_WARRIOR = 1,           // Combat unit
	UNIT_WORKER = 2             // Resource-gathering unit
} t_unit_type;
```

*Good to know:*
- Warriors deal damage, while workers gather resources or perform other tasks to support the team.

---

### 🛠️ `typedef struct s_unit_config`
Defines the configuration for units, including their stats and abilities.

```c
typedef struct s_unit_config
{
	char *name;                 // Name of the unit (e.g., "Warrior")
	t_unit_type type_id;        // Type of the unit (warrior, worker)
	unsigned long cost;         // Cost to create the unit
	unsigned long hp;           // Health points
	unsigned long dmg_core;     // Damage to cores
	unsigned long dmg_unit;     // Damage to other units
	unsigned long dmg_resource; // Damage to resources
	unsigned long max_range;    // Maximum attack range
	unsigned long min_range;    // Minimum attack range
	unsigned long speed;        // Unit movement speed
} t_unit_config;
```

*Good to know:*
- Units have specialized roles: some are better for attacking cores, while others excel at resource gathering or unit combat.

---

### 🏴‍☠️ `typedef struct s_team_config`
Defines the configuration of a team, including its ID and name.

```c
typedef struct s_team_config
{
	unsigned long id;           // Team's unique identifier
	char *name;                 // Name of the team
} t_team_config;
```

---

### 🌾 `typedef struct s_resource_config`
Defines the configuration for resources, including their health and value.

```c
typedef struct s_resource_config
{
	unsigned long type_id;      // Resource type identifier
	unsigned long hp;           // Health points of the resource
	unsigned long balance_value; // Value added to the team’s balance when collected
} t_resource_config;
```

*Good to know:*
- Resources are vital for team economy, and their balance_value increases the team’s resource pool.

---

### 🗺️ `typedef struct s_config`
Represents the game's configuration, containing global settings like map size and team/unit configurations.

```c
typedef struct s_config
{
	unsigned long height;        // Map height
	unsigned long width;         // Map width
	unsigned long idle_income;   // Income generated while idle
	unsigned long core_hp;       // Health points for cores
	t_team_config *teams;        // Pointer to the team configurations
	t_unit_config *units;        // Pointer to the unit configurations
	t_resource_config *resources; // Pointer to the resource configurations
} t_config;
```

---

### 🕹️ `typedef struct s_game`
Represents the entire game state, containing everything from status to teams, cores, resources, units, and actions.

> Note: This struct is globally accessable by just typing `game`

```c
typedef struct s_game
{
	t_status status;             // Current game status (OK, Paused, End, etc.)
	t_config config;             // Game configuration (map size, teams, units, etc.)
	unsigned long my_team_id;    // ID of your team
	t_team *teams;               // Pointer to all teams in the game
	t_obj *cores;                // Pointer to all cores
	t_obj *resources;            // Pointer to all resources
	t_obj *units;                // Pointer to all units
	t_actions actions;           // List of actions (create, travel, attack)
} t_game;
```

*Good to know:*
- **t_game** is the central structure that stores everything happening in the game. Interacting with this structure gives you full access to game data like team status, units, and actions.
