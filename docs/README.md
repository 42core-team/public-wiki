## This is the official CORE documentation

### Getting started
#### Installation
To get started to write your own CORE bot you will have to do the following:
- Be a registered CORE participant/team ([How?](Get a CORE participant))
- Have received an invite link to your CORE repository on GitHub (You will get that once you are a registered CORE participant and the event is about to start)

After you got all that you can either follow the step-by-step guide in [text-form](#### Text Guide) or you watch the [video guide](##### Video Guide)

##### Text Guide
1. Fork your CORE-Repository on GitHub
2. Clone it and open it in preferably [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. Get the [Dev Container Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) 
4. Start the Docker Engine
5. Then head to the bottom left of your VSCode window and click on the most bottom left icon. Once that's done a small VSCode menu should have opened where you have to click the "Reopen in Container" option and let it download and set-up everything on it's own.
6. Let it sit until it's complete and you are inside the Container Developing Area
7. To confirm that it worked open a new Terminal from inside VSCode and run the `make` command. Head to your browser of choice and type `localhost` (yes without port) into the search bar. You should see the Visualizer and in VSCode your console should be spamming "Crazy CORE Bot"
8. Once you are inside the Container Developing Area head to the `src/` folder and start coding ðŸ˜Ž
