# ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

---

### 🔧 Can I edit the standard library to my liking?
> **Yes, of course!** We provide the bare-bones library to help you get started, but you're encouraged to modify and expand it based on your specific needs. Customize it to fit your bot’s logic and behavior!

---

### 💻 How do I debug my bot?
> You can use the built-in debugging tools in **VSCode** or add logging statements inside your user loop to track your bot’s behavior. Also, use breakpoints in your code to pause execution and inspect variables at runtime.

---

### 🐞 What should I do if my bot isn't responding?
> First, make sure the **Docker container** is running properly and that you're able to see logs from your bot in the terminal. Check for any errors in the console or in your logs. Double-check the user loop logic to ensure it’s being executed as expected.

---

### 🤔 Can I collaborate with teammates on the same bot?
> Absolutely! If you're working as part of a team, you can use **GitHub** to collaborate. You and your team mates should all be invited to the repository. Maybe learn how the **issue** system on **GitHub** works. (This also helps you in general to know how to collaborate on GitHub)

---

### 📚 Are there any limitations to what I can add to the bot?
> There are no specific limitations—you're free to use any techniques, or patterns that fit your needs. You are allowed to use all standard libraries there are and we provide and all the other things you have to code on your own.

---

### 🌍 Can I test my bot locally before pushing it to GitHub?
> Definitely. You can run and test your bot inside the **Docker container** locally by using the VSCode terminal and typing `make` to then check the game in your browser with the `localhost` url. Once you're satisfied with your bot’s behavior, you can push the changes to GitHub.

---

### 🤷 What if I need help during development?
> If you run into issues, check the **documentation**, browse existing issues on the project’s **GitHub repository**, or ask for help from your peers.
