# **🌌 Units of the Wasteland**

In this barren world, where survival is the ultimate currency, only a handful of specialized individuals have risen to the challenge. Each unit carries the weight of its past and the hope of a better future—or at least the next meal. Meet the elite forces of the wasteland: the ones who fight, build, and heal in a world that has forgotten mercy.


## **⚔️ Warrior: The Vanguard of Survival**

> *"Where others see chaos, I see opportunity. My blade shall carve the future from the ruins of the past."*

The Warrior is the embodiment of raw strength and relentless determination. Forged in the fires of anarchy, these brave souls are the first to charge into battle, their armor pieced together from scavenged metal and shattered dreams. With every swing of their weapon, they remind the wasteland that survival isn’t given—it’s taken.

- **Role**: Frontline combatant and protector of allies.  
- **Strengths**: High durability and melee power.  
- **Backstory**: Warriors were once defenders of crumbled cities. Now, they wander the deserts, their hearts hardened as much as the steel they wield.  


## **⛏️ Worker: The Relentless Miner**

> *"Dig deep, dig fast. The earth holds the secrets we need, and I will uncover them before the vultures circle overhead."*

The Worker is the backbone of every clan, tirelessly extracting the precious remnants of resources from the earth. They are masters of improvisation, wielding makeshift tools and navigating treacherous terrain to unearth the lifeblood of survival—whether it's salt, scrap, or sustenance.

- **Role**: Resource gatherer and logistics expert.  
- **Strengths**: Efficient collection and supply chain maintenance.  
- **Backstory**: Once humble laborers, Workers became indispensable when resources dwindled. Without them, even the strongest armies would fall to hunger and despair.


## **🛡️ Tank: The Juggernaut**

> *"You can try to stop me, but you'll need more than what you've got. Bring it on."*

The Tank is a walking fortress, built to withstand the harshest blows the wasteland can deliver. Adorned in scavenged armor that barely holds together, they lumber through enemy lines like unstoppable titans, shielding their comrades from harm. Where Tanks tread, destruction follows.

- **Role**: Defensive powerhouse and damage absorber.  
- **Strengths**: Unmatched durability and crowd control.  
- **Backstory**: Tanks were once machines of war, piloted by desperate souls who clung to the notion of invincibility. Now, they are the spearheads of survival, their drivers' humanity slowly slipping away under the weight of their steel cocoons.


## **🏹 Archer: The Shadow of Precision**

> *"From the shadows, I see all. You won’t see me—but you'll feel me."*

In the wasteland, distance is safety, and the Archer is a master of exploiting that truth. They stalk the barren landscapes, their eyes sharper than the scavenged arrows they let loose. Precision and stealth define their existence, as they rain death upon their enemies from afar.

- **Role**: Long-range specialist and scout.  
- **Strengths**: High damage at range and strategic positioning.  
- **Backstory**: Archers were once hunters of game, providing for their families. Now, they hunt for survival, their prey often walking on two legs instead of four.


## **💊 Healer: The Beacon of Hope**

> *"Even in a world as broken as this, I refuse to let the light of life extinguish completely."*

The Healer is a rare soul, clinging to the shreds of humanity left in the wasteland. While others destroy, the Healer rebuilds—mending wounds and rekindling hope where there is none. They carry with them the knowledge of the old world, blending science and instinct to save lives.

- **Role**: Medic and support specialist.  
- **Strengths**: Restores health and bolsters allies in combat.  
- **Backstory**: Healers are remnants of the medical community, their compassion an anomaly in a world driven by greed and violence. Many see them as beacons of hope; others see them as naive fools destined to be swallowed by the wasteland.


## **⚡ Together, They Forge the Future**

> In a world where trust is a liability, these units form bonds stronger than steel. Each carries the weight of their past, but together, they are more than survivors—they are the architects of a new era. Whether fighting for resources or striving to carve out a patch of stability in the chaos, they are the last hope of the wasteland.
