# ðŸ”„ User Loop Documentation

The **User Loop** is a critical function that is called multiple times per second. Itâ€™s where youâ€™ll write the core logic of your bot. Think of it as the main heartbeat of your bot's behavior.

If you're familiar with Unity, the `ft_user_loop` function is very similar to the **Update** function in Unity scripts. Just as Unity's Update function handles per-frame logic, the user loop manages per-cycle logic for your bot, enabling it to react and adapt in real time.

### ðŸ’¡ How to Use the User Loop
You can implement your botâ€™s core behavior directly within the `ft_user_loop` function. This is where you'll define the actions, decision-making, and responses that your bot should perform continuously.

- **Core Logic**: The user loop is where you handle real-time operations and interactions.
- **Execution Speed**: Since the function runs many times per second, itâ€™s optimized for responsive bot behavior.

### ðŸ“„ Example Usage
For a more detailed example on how to implement the user loop, check out the [example code](../README.md#Example-code).

> ðŸ’» **Pro Tip**: Keep your logic efficient! Since the user loop is called frequently, ensuring your code runs smoothly will help avoid performance bottlenecks.
