# CORE LORE

In the year 2542, as the burned remains of World War III ushered in
a fragile new beginning, Earth rose once more from the ashes of a
nuclear wasteland. Hidden aristocrats emerged from their secret
bunkers, resplendent in opulence, to reclaim a land both scarred
and grim.
Across this ravaged realm, humanity had been twisted into ghastly
forms: ghostly skeletons wandered like lost souls, while ugly green
goblins - reminders of what once was - stalked the barren wilds.

Driven by a perverse desire for luxury and brutal entertainment,
these aristocrats built vast arenas of horror. Within these
bloodstained colosseums, condemned creatures were forced to engage
in a savage dance for survival, their suffering displayed as a
repulsive show for those who delight in cruelty.

Dear Strategist, this letter is not a request, it's an order - a
call to arms on the eve of battle. Your destiny, and indeed your
very life, are bound to the fate of these warriors.

The time has come to gather your forces with precision and courage,
turning every command into a stroke of genius. Now, as you stand on
the brink of combat, let your resolve shine like a guiding light.

Embrace the challenge and let your code strike true like a finely
honed blade.

Onward - to glory!
